## Risk Adjustments & Scenarios

### Downside Case (30% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Slower user growth (50% of base)
- Higher CAC ($25 vs $15)
- Lower engagement (8 challenges vs 12)

**Year 3 Results:**
- Revenue: $12.5M (vs $30M base)
- EBITDA: -$2M (vs $8M base)
- Additional funding needed: $5M bridge round

### Base Case (50% probability)
- As outlined in main projections
- Year 3: $30M revenue, $8M EBITDA

### Upside Case (20% probability)

**Assumptions:**
- Viral growth exceeds expectations (2x base)
- Lower CAC ($8 via referrals)
- Higher engagement (18 challenges/month)
- Premium adoption (20% vs 10%)

**Year 3 Results:**
- Revenue: $75M (vs $30M base)
- EBITDA: $26M (vs $8M base)
- Profitable earlier, Series B delayed or skipped

### Expected Value

**EV = (Downside × 30%) + (Base × 50%) + (Upside × 20%)**
**EV = ($12.5M × 0.3) + ($30M × 0.5) + ($75M × 0.2)**
**EV = $3.75M + $15M + $15M = $33.75M**

**Risk-Adjusted Year 3 Revenue: $33.75M**
